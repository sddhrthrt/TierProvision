measure performance:
  - rtt of the node
  - tat of the request (inside app)
  - requested rtt = rtt + tat + rtt
  - 

20, 120, 200 - 600ms

20 
a: tat 85 - 125

120
a: tat 40 - 160

200 
a: tat 25 - 225 - CPU, MEM, NETIO


1: heartbeat:
  - for each task in taskstatus:
      check heartbeat
      if missing:
        create taskrequest.
1.5: compare rtt vs achieved rtt
  - for task in taskstatus:
      if overperforming:
        reprovision(taskstatus, upwards)
2: power:
  - power_consumed & cpu & req
3: cpu, memory, disk and bandwidth contention:
  - try reprovisining
  - reprovisioning should take care. 

reprovisioning:
1: migrate lowest tat, try if they'll still perform well. 
2: if lower nodes free: migrate lightest/fastest to lower (guess the contention, power)
3: if node too "busy": migrate upwards

"busy": power, resource contention

taskstatus: {node: tat, node: rtt}
